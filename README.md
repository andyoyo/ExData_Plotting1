# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-assignment-1

This repository contains the R scripts to generate the plots indicated in the first Assignment
of the course.

Each script creates one of the plots, the resulting .png files can also be found in this repository.
The steps inside each script do the following:
    - Read the dataset.
    - Subset the necessary variables.
    - Plot what is required.
    - Save a .png file and reset the default graphic device.

The charts were created using the Electric power consumption dataset in .txt format.
